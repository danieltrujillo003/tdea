## Description

With this app, a coordinator can create courses, see students suscribed to each course, remove students suscriptions and switch courses status between avaliable and closed. On the other hand, students can see all **avaliable** courses and suscribe (only once) to the desired course.

## Setup

Run the following commands in the terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/danieltrujillo003/tdea.git`
2. `cd tdea/week2/assignment`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`

Now you have the app running on http://localhost:3000/. Go to to that URL and explore the menu and all of the features.
